# Fruit Ninjas
 
In this game , I try to learn some optimization for the game, such as i use coroutine instead of invoke and i use object pooling to spawn the fruit and bombs for the game optimization.

One Example Of The Use Of Coroutine (SpawnManager.cs) :

In this game , All of my code use the SRP Principles.
